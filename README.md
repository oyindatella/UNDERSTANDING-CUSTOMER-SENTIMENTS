# UNDERSTANDING-CUSTOMER-SENTIMENTS
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR A UK RESTAURANT ON YELP TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS.

A restaurant management team is looking for ways to better understand the voice of the customers. They are interested in what aspects of the restaurant experience affect their review rating scores. I collected/scraped data on 3,000 Yelp reviews to better understand customer sentiments about their business, make informed managerial decisions, and increase customer satisfaction.
